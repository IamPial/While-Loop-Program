# While Loop Program

This project demonstrates the use of a while loop in JavaScript. It consists of a simple HTML page and a linked JavaScript file that contains the implementation.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that sets up the structure of the webpage and links the JavaScript file.
- **index.js**: The JavaScript file containing the while loop logic.

## Features:

- A web-based program to demonstrate the functionality of a while loop.
- A simple and beginner-friendly codebase to understand JavaScript loops.


#Requirements:

   1. A modern web browser
   2. Basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript

#How It Works:

  1.The index.html file includes the structure of the webpage.
  2.The index.js file contains the JavaScript logic for the while loop.
  3.When you open index.html, the script runs and displays its output in the browser's developer console or on the webpage (depending on your implementation).
